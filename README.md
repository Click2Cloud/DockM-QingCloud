# Introduction 

DockM application is a native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single virtual Docker host. Manager nodes perform orchestration and cluster management. Applications can be deployed as services (or “microservices”) in a Swarm cluster. Worker nodes receive and execute tasks from the manager nodes. Deployment is simpler and Swarm mode is included in Docker Engine. Integrates with Docker Compose and Docker CLI – native Docker tools. Many of the Docker CLI commands will work with Swarm. 

# Getting Started

The guideline for creating the DockM cluster on Qing Cloud is available [here](docs/README-en-US.md).
